tnm.0.d:0 "At the end of WWI, Ottoman Empire was defeated, which lead to the signing of Armistice of Mudros allowing Entente to occupy straits of Bosporus and Dardanelles. Armistice would also give them the right to occupy any territory in case there was a threat to their security. Invasions began right after with France and Italy on the south, Armenia on the east and England with Greece on the west. With the Ottoman Empire capital Constantinople in the hands of Entente soldiers, it is in no doubt that Sultan is unable to act on his own will. Brave Mirliva Mustafa Kemal Pasha declared Amasya Circular in protest of all these un-justified invasions marking the beggining of Turkish National Movement.  In the day of 15 May 1919 as Greece troops began landing in Smyrna. When Hasan Tahsin, a journalist, fired the first bullet because he saw an unarmed Turkish soldier get stabbed to death for refusing to shout 'Zito Venizelos!' it marked the beggining of the conflict."
